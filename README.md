# file-system

## Description

This is a GROUP assignment written in C.

Our team have been designing components of a file system that have defined the goals and designed the directory entry structure, the volume structure and the free space. We will need to format our volume, create and maintain a free space management system, initialize a root directory and maintain directory information, create, read, write, and delete files, and display info.
<br><br>
A shell program designed to demonstrate our file system called fsshell.c is proviced.  It has a number of built in functions works, these are:
```
ls - Lists the file in a directory
cp - Copies a file - source [dest]
mv - Moves a file - source dest
md - Make a new directory
rm - Removes a file or directory
touch - creates a file
cat - (limited functionality) displays the contents of a file
cp2l - Copies a file from the test file system to the linux file system
cp2fs - Copies a file from the Linux file system to the test file system
cd - Changes directory
pwd - Prints the working directory
history - Prints out the history
help - Prints out help
```

## The project is in three phases
 - The first phase is the "formatting" the volume.
 - The second phase is the implementation of the directory based functions.
 - The final phase is the implementation of the file operations.
